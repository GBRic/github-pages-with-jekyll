 Gordon Richard 

## Personal Information
Hi, my name is Gordon and I am a Swiss-Australian dual citizen. After earning a sales diploma in Switzerland, I worked selling musical instruments. I would play analog and digital synthesizers and the bass guitar at live venues and do recordings in studios. I then met my wife when I came to live in Australia. I am a learner of Mandarin and am fluent in German and English.

## Interest in IT
My father is a programmer. At a young age, he would introduce me to games and screensavers. As the years went by, I encountered computers in more places outside my home as they began to become common in the households of many people. One memory I have is that of a friend's older brother booting up Linux, then explaining to us what the kernel was doing. I never forgot the excitement in his voice, even though I remained clueless as to what his explanations meant. As I grew older, I wanted to know what was going on under the hood of a computer and within its software. My work career however progressed in a different direction. Today, I am still as intrigued by computers as ever and I enjoy using them to do work, study and create arts.

Based on the reviews of former and current students and the university's ranking, I decided to gain entry into the course via OUA (Open Universities Australia). I am living the expatriate lifestyle currently in Taiwan. The Bachelor of Information Technologies pathway through RMIT fits my way of living. It enables me to conduct my studies the way it suits me, which in my case means that I can spend more time with loved ones.

Since the IT industry is changing very rapidly, I anticipate to find myself at the forefront of learning about new developments within the sector during my studies. Very important to me personally, however, is to learn about the _how_, how companies structure their teams, how people end up in the roles they do, how to establish myself and how to be successful doing the things I love. 

## Ideal Job

### Data Engineer

As a data engineer, my responsibilities are to communicate with teams, to help improve the bank's information processing system and to maintain it. I consider this an appealing opportunity because the role factors in different tasks, such as communicating with others as well as writing scripts and improving the databases. I would appreciate the stable nature of the employment for which large firms are known for.

My research suggests that firms typically seek to hire applicants with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a similar field. For senior positions, a doctor's degree is preferred. Experience and knowledge necessary for this particular role are:

   - Bachelor degree
   - Teamwork skills
   - Data analysis, use of the Tableau program 
   - Python programming language
   - SQL

I describe my current skills as follows: I am a beginner when it comes to programming languages, I have started learning Java and C++. I have advanced teamwork skills, in my prior career I have continuously worked in teams. I am qualified in audio mixing and mastering as well as the sale of professional audio equipment. 

To match the requirements for this position, I plan to obtain a Bachelor's degree in Information Technologies, through RMIT. I build on my teamwork skills during the courses, which include many group work elements. I plan to connect with people already working as data engineers, to learn about their career path, as well as learning the Python programming language after I progressed in Java. As for SQL and Tableau, I gain exposure by accessing the internet and using freely available resources for learning, for example, Udemy.com. Next, I would complete courses with accreditation, the kind of which would be determined by the demand of my employer. Upon completion of these steps, I would seek an internship or full-time position where I could gain experience working closely with data engineers or teams that are involved with them. Once I arrive at that point, I directly apply for a position as a Junior Data Engineer.

### INTP

INTP: The Thinker

INTP (introverted, intuitive, thinking, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality types described by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). INTPs are often described as quiet and analytical. They enjoy spending time alone, thinking about how things work and coming up with solutions to problems. According to psychologist David Keirsey, creator of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately one to five percent of people have an INTP personality type.

INTP Characteristics

The MBTI identifies personality preferences and tendencies in four key areas: 1) Extraversion vs Introversion, 2) Sensing vs Intuition, 3) Thinking vs Feeling and 4) Judging vs Perceiving. As you can tell from the four-letter acronym, INTP stands for Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Perceiving.

  - Introversion (I): INTPs prefer to socialize with a small group of close friends.
  - Intuition (N): INTPs tend to think about the big picture, rather than focusing on every tiny detail.
  - Thinking (T): INTPs are logical and base decisions on objective information rather than subjective feelings.
  - Perceiving (P): INTPs like to keep their options open and feel limited by structure and planning.

Some of the common characteristics exhibited by people with this personality type include:
   _Quiet, reserved and thoughtful
    Enjoys theoretical thinking
    Tends to be flexible and tolerant
    Highly logical and objective
    Good at thinking “outside of the box”_

As introverts, INTPs prefer spending time alone for the most part. Unlike extraverts who gain energy from interacting with a wide group of people, introverts must expend energy in social situations. After being around a lot of people, an INTP might feel like they need to spend some time alone to recharge and find balance. While they may be shy around people they do not know well, INTPs tend to be warm and friendly with their close group of family and friends.

INTPs can be very independent and place a great deal of emphasis on personal freedom and autonomy. In some cases, they can be aggravated by authority figures, particularly those that they feel are trying to suppress their ability to think and act for themselves. Because of this, INTPs typically do best in careers with they have a great deal of flexibility and independence.

Because INTPs enjoy solitude and deep thinking, they sometimes strike others as aloof and detached. At times, people with this personality type can get lost in their own thoughts and lose track of the outside world. They love ideas and place a high value on intelligence and knowledge.

In social situations, INTPs tend to be quite easy-going and tolerant. However, they can become unyielding when their beliefs or convictions are challenged. Their high emphasis on logic can make it difficult to not correct others in situations where other people present arguments that are not rational or logical. Because they rely on their own minds rather than others, they can also be very difficult to persuade.

### Reflector

Reflectors like to observe from many different perspectives. They collect data, both first hand and from others, and prefer to think about it thoroughly before coming to any conclusion. The thorough collection and analysis of data about experiences is what counts, so they tend to postpone definitive conclusions for as long as possible. They are thoughtful people who would like to consider all possible angles and implications before making a move. They prefer to take a back seat in meetings and discussions. They enjoy observing other people in action. They listen to others and get the drift of the discussion before making their own points. They tend to adopt a low profile and have a slightly distant, tolerant, unruffled air about them. When they act it is part of a large picture which includes the past as well as the present and others’ observations as well as their own.

Strengths of a Reflector

- Careful
- Thorough and methodical
- Thoughtful
- Good at listening to others and assimilating information
- Rarely jumps to conclusions

## My thoughts on Personality tests
In conclusion, while there certainly is a degree of truth in the statements of these generated tests, I do not believe that people, in general, can be put in such broadly defined categories. When I tried to recreate the result of my first Myers-Briggs test, again answering truthfully, the outcome was ENFJ. Some characteristics of this personality type are the exact opposite of the INTP type. While I appreciate that there are psychological tools like the Myers - Briggs test, to me personally people are more nuanced than what can be captured in a single test. 

The particular result I scored indicates that in a team situation, I would be using my analytical skills while being more introverted. Once I got to know everyone, I would be warm and welcoming. Being a "thinker", it could mean that when working in a team, I will fixate on the ideas I am having without necessarily agreeing with everyone else's ideas. That being said, overall I would show myself as a  tolerant and easy-going person.   

Teams perform better when people with diverse personalities collaborate. Taking the INTP - type of personality as an example, a scenario where an INTP works with other INTPs, one could imagine that, amongst the team, communication would be reduced while everyone individually would come up with great ideas. However, it would be necessary to include at least one person or more with communicative personality types to bring these ideas together and turn them into reality.

## Project idea

My project called ???? is an online platform that enables programmers, web-designers and other skilled professionals to connect with customers seeking IT solutions. It serves small businesses in need of networking solutions and households that want to transform their property with smart home tech. ??? connects them with IT professionals who give advice, improve existing systems or create customisations.

Smart gadgets, via the "Internet of things" (IOT), today bring improved quality of life to patients and elderely people, enhance the performance of professionals and deliver convenience to people around the globe. Small things can make a huge difference. A sensor designed to measure, detect or capture a thing can be accessible via remote control and access. Different single components can be programmed to recognise each other and pass on data and respond to user inputs. Fridges can talk to their hungry owners and order food. Home automation is growing in Australia. Projections are a 40.6 percent household penetration by 2023, up by 19.5% from this year's estimates. https://www.statista.com/outlook/279/107/smart-home/australia
There are millions of accessible options and ways to improve someones life using existing technologies. The most creative solutions are provided by people with advanced knowledge of the technology. In essence, not everyone is aware or possesses the know-how to make those changes, while on the other hand, for many graduating IT professionals, getting hands on work experience is valuable for their future careers. What if this exchange takes place on a platform with the layout of a marketplace, where users offer their projects, to be realised by those with the know-how. Furthermore, being able to share project ideas and inspire others, ??? is more than just a space for where odd jobs can be found. 

Sign up and user types:

Users access and sign up to ??? via an application or their browser. The fields users fill out in order to create an account are their name and address, along with email address, phone number and a password. There are two types of free account. 
- People with qualifications such as work experience, university degrees and diplomas, certificates or statements of attainment, submit proof of their skills. Review of their submissions is necessary to confirm authenticity. Access to a pro-account to begin work on open projects is then granted. 
- Users who do not provide any documentation of their skills are assumed to be normal users who can post work requests, seek inspiration or show their tech-creations and solutions within a micro blog layout. For them, there are many incentives to sign up for an account and participate.

All signed up users must be elligible Australian citizens or residents and minimum 18 years of age.

Incentives

- Access to skilled professionals
On the platform, normal users may open a work request. ??? determines suitable pro-users for the task based on their location, qualification and reviews and notifies both parties via email or message.
- Exchange of information/reviews
Reviews and reading and creating comments is enabled for users with an account. Pro-account users are reviewed based on criteria such as the quality of their work, friendlieness and reliability.
- Rewards through weekly/monthly/yearly competitions
There are three types of competitions, weekly, monthly and yearly and they are awarded in two distinct categories, for content creators and best performing pro-user. They all conclude in the award of prices for the users who win. 
- Ad free environment
There are no ads for users with an account.
- Customisations and content
Include but are not limited to: Avatar creation, user flair and unlimited blog posts. 

Users may still share project ideas without the need to sign up, however they will not receive any of the benefits. Accessing more than a certain number of posts will prompt users to sign up to continue browsing.

Work requests by users

A main feature of ??? are work requests, whereas only specifically IT related requests are permitted. There are at least two forms of work request: Individual requests and group requests. Individual requests are for tasks that can be performed and completed by a single person in a given time frame. Group requests are for more complex projects that can only be accomplished by a team. Group requests work by finding and suggesting pro-accounts, putting together a team comprising of members with a complimentary skill set. Further there can be different types of requests, depending on wether the work can be done remotely or on-site. Similar to common marketplace pinboards, all requests are publicly accessible. Users determine the exact nature of the request using a pre-defined form, which seeks to cover all possible appliances and methods. Additionally, users may ask for further customisations, the pre-defined form cannot be left blank however. Pro-users who choose to act on a request consider the distance to their current location and the technical difficulty of the request. They then hit a button to accept the request, upon which they then enter their base rate of pay per hour of work plus cost for use of materials for said request. Users may review this and then decide to finalise their request. Payment is immidiately taken and goes into escrow. This is a fundamentally important part of the service ??? provides, it is therefore here where a low percentage service fee is applicable. All parties confirm that the work has been completed and the money is released by the escrow service. Should there be dissatisfaction with the performance of the pro-user, the money could be withheld if there is sufficient proof of such claim. Dissatisfaction is only confirmed if one or more of the work request's items both parties have agreed upon are not met, this may or may not include things such as the time frame in which the work is expected to be completed. Through this clause, users are able to define which exact conditions need to be matched for a request to be considered completed.
